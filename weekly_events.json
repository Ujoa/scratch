We believe alcoholism is a family illness, and that changed attitudes can aid recovery. Al\u002DAnon has but one purpose: to help friends and families of alcoholics. We do this by practicing the Twelve Steps, by welcoming and giving comfort to families and friends of alcoholics, and by giving understanding and encouragement to the alcoholic.
